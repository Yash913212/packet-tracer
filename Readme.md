 Packet Tracer (Network Simulation API)

A simple network simulation API built using **Node.js + Express**, designed to simulate how a packet travels through a network using:
- DNS Resolution
- Routing (Longest Prefix Match)
- Firewall Rule Checks
- TTL (Time-To-Live)

The API returns a **hop-by-hop trace** showing each step the packet takes.

 Features

Resolve domain to IP using local DNS records  
Find next hop using longest prefix match  
Check firewall rules before forwarding  
Simulate TTL expiry  
JSON-based network configuration  
Simple trace output for each packet
